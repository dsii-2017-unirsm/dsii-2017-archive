# coding

In this folder I am going to upload some tests on world maps coding in P5.js.

***earthquake-01***

Earthquake data visualization from Daniel Shiffman's [Coding Challenge #57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiYdOwOrGyc). Data are from the [United States Geological Survey](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/) and are visualised by mapping the latitude, longitude and the magnitude of earthquakes. The map imagery is pulled from mapbox.js and the math demonstrated coverts latitude, longitude to x,y via Web Mercator.
