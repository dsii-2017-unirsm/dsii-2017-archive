***what is***

An art installation presented at the Peacock Visual Arts centre in Aberdeen, Scotland featuring an empty room and a box filled with yellow balls falling from the ceiling every time an article about someone being killed is published. 

***how it works***

A costum software regularly scans headlines from 4.500 English newspapers and an algorithm detects when someone has been reported as "killed".
A mechanically-controlled clear acrylic box is fixed to the ceiling of one of the centre's rooms and contains thousands of small yellow plastic balls.
The algorithm parses the data and for each death it finds, it makes the mechanism drop one ball to the floor.
The balls therefore accumulate on the floor during the course of the exhibition.

***what does it mean***

We stare at the total amount of deaths caused by man, staying still and waiting for other deaths to come.
We think we just can not help and all those deaths are inevitable.
Probably, the reason why we feel a sense of excitement in waiting for a new ball to fall is the same reason why newspapers live more of bad news than of good ones. 

***what if...***

...the installation featured a second box with green balls falling only when someone dies of natural causes?
